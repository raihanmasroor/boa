# Design System -- Band of Agents

> **Scope note (2026-05-17):** Color is unified across the TUI and the web dashboard via the canonical theme TOML model. The TUI renders directly from a `Theme`; the web dashboard renders from a server-side projection (`ResolvedTheme`) of the same `Theme`. Surfaces (TUI vs web vs marketing) still differ on typography, density, and motion, but the color palette follows the user's chosen theme on both code surfaces. See the [Theme system](#theme-system) and [Web Dashboard subset](#web-dashboard-subset) sections below.

## Product Context
- **What this is:** Terminal session manager for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex, Mistral Vibe, etc.)
- **Who it's for:** Developers who run multiple AI coding agents in parallel and want a single dashboard to manage them
- **Space/industry:** Developer tools, terminal utilities, AI coding infrastructure
- **Project type:** Open source CLI/TUI tool with a marketing/docs website (Astro + Tailwind)
- **Peers:** Warp, Zed, Ghostty, tmux ecosystem tools

## Aesthetic Direction
- **Direction:** Industrial Warmth
- **Decoration level:** Intentional -- subtle surface gradients, warm glow accents, no gratuitous ornamentation
- **Mood:** Terminal-native, engineer-made, warm. Like a well-made tool with visible craft. Not a glossy Linear clone, not brutalist either. The amber copper palette is the soul; everything reinforces it.
- **What we avoid:** Purple/violet gradients, centered-everything layouts, uniform 3-column grids with colored icon circles, generic stock hero sections, the "Linear style" dark-mode template that every dev tool ships

## Typography
- **Display/Hero:** Satoshi (900, 700, 600) -- geometric like Inter but with distinctive letterforms (double-storey "a", geometric "g", wider "e"). Feels engineered, which matches a Rust/terminal product. Loaded from fontshare.com.
- **Body:** DM Sans (400, 500, 600) -- clean, excellent legibility, great tabular numerals for docs and data. Not overused. Pairs well with Satoshi's geometry.
- **UI/Labels:** DM Sans (same as body) at 13-14px
- **Data/Tables:** DM Sans with tabular-nums feature, or JetBrains Mono for code-adjacent data
- **Code:** JetBrains Mono (400, 500) -- already in use, proven, excellent at small sizes
- **Monospace accents:** JetBrains Mono at 11-12px for section labels, version badges, metadata, terminal-style UI elements. This reinforces the terminal-native identity.
- **Loading:** Satoshi from `https://api.fontshare.com/v2/css?f[]=satoshi@400,500,600,700,900&display=swap`, DM Sans + JetBrains Mono from Google Fonts
- **Scale:** 11 / 12 / 13 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 56 / 64 / 80px
- **Why not Inter?** It's the default pick for every dev tool since 2020. Works fine, zero personality. Satoshi has the same geometric clarity with actual character.

## Color

### Approach: Refined Copper + Muted Teal
Most dev tools are cold (blue, purple, teal-only). BOA is warm. The amber/copper primary against slate/navy surfaces reads "professional terminal tool with a point of view." The muted teal accent ties directly to the agent nodes in the logo and creates complementary tension with the amber.

### Dark Mode
Default. Deep navy surfaces (#020617 to #0f172a), white/light gray text, brand amber for emphasis.

### Light Mode
Inverted surfaces (#f8fafc to #ffffff), dark text (#0f172a to #334155), brand shifts to brand-700/800 for sufficient contrast on light backgrounds.

## Spacing
- **Base unit:** 4px
- **Density:** Comfortable
- **Scale:** 2xs(2) xs(4) sm(8) md(16) lg(24) xl(32) 2xl(48) 3xl(64)

## Layout
- **Approach:** Editorial with grid discipline -- left-aligned hero, asymmetric feature cards, generous whitespace between sections
- **Grid:** Content max-width 1200px. Features use asymmetric grids (e.g., 1.4fr + 1fr) rather than uniform columns.
- **Max content width:** 1200px (container), 720px (prose/docs)
- **Border radius:** sm:4px, md:8px, lg:12px, full:9999px (pills/badges)
- **Terminal-native accents:** Monospace section labels, version badges, and metadata throughout the site reinforce the terminal identity
- **Hero pattern:** Left-aligned title + subtitle + CTA, not centered-everything. Reads as authoritative and intentional.
- **Feature cards:** Asymmetric grid with one featured card spanning 2 rows alongside smaller supporting cards. Creates visual hierarchy instead of flat 3-column uniformity.

## Motion
- **Approach:** Minimal-functional
- **Easing:** enter(ease-out / cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)) exit(ease-in / cubic-bezier(0.7, 0, 0.84, 0)) move(ease-in-out / cubic-bezier(0.45, 0, 0.55, 1))
- **Duration:** micro(75ms) short(150ms) medium(300ms)
- **Scroll animations:** Subtle entrance (fade + 12px translate, 0.4s ease-out). No decorative motion. A terminal tool that's restrained in motion reads as confident.

## Logo
- **Concept:** Stacked terminal windows. Two overlapping terminal window shapes in amber/copper communicate "managing multiple agent sessions from a terminal."
- **Full mark:** Two stacked terminal windows (back window darker, front window in brand amber with title bar dots and `$` prompt + cursor). Used for all contexts.
- **Circular mark:** Same stacked windows centered on a surface-900 (#0f172a) circle. Used for YouTube, social avatars.
- **Colors:** Front window uses brand amber gradient (#fbbf24 to #d97706). Back window uses brand-700/800 (#92400e to #78350f). Title bar dots use brand-700 (#b45309). Prompt and cursor use brand-50 (#fef3c7).
- **Social preview:** Dark navy gradient background with subtle grid, icon + "boa" text + "BAND OF AGENTS" subtitle, tagline "Conquer your codebase.", decorative scattered terminal shapes in corners.

## TUI (ratatui)

The TUI layout and information architecture are solid. These recommendations refine the visual treatment without changing functionality.

### Empire Theme (new default)

Replace the Phosphor theme as default. Phosphor's bright lime green on dark green reads as "hacker terminal." The Empire theme uses the design system palette and reads as "professional tool."

Keep Phosphor, Tokyo Night Storm, Catppuccin Latte, and Dracula as options. Add Empire and make it the default.

### Rounded Borders

Switch all `Block` widgets from sharp corners (`┌┐└┘`) to rounded (`╭╮╰╯`):

```rust
Block::default()
    .borders(Borders::ALL)
    .border_type(BorderType::Rounded)  // add this line
```

Apply to: list panel, preview panel, all dialogs, help overlay, settings panels. This is the single highest-impact visual change for modernizing the TUI. ~15 lines across the codebase.

### Inner Padding

Add 1 character of horizontal padding inside panels so content doesn't butt against borders:

```rust
Block::default()
    .borders(Borders::ALL)
    .border_type(BorderType::Rounded)
    .padding(Padding::horizontal(1))  // add this line
```

Apply to: list panel, preview panel. Not needed on dialogs (they already manage internal spacing). The `block.inner()` call automatically accounts for padding.

### Single Panel Seam

Eliminate the double-border where the list and preview panels meet. Currently both panels have `Borders::ALL`, creating a heavy `││` seam. Instead:

- List panel: `Borders::TOP | Borders::LEFT | Borders::BOTTOM` (drop right border)
- Preview panel: keep `Borders::ALL` (its left border becomes the shared separator)

This makes the two panels feel like one cohesive surface with a divider rather than two separate boxes.

### What to Leave Alone

- **Status icons** (●◐○✕■◌✗) -- clean, universally readable, not "hacky"
- **Information density** in the session list -- BOA is a dashboard, density is correct
- **Dialog structure** -- functional, well-proportioned, dialogs should be boxed
- **Status bar layout** -- the key/description/separator pattern is learnable and functional
- **The other 5 themes** -- keep them all as options for users who prefer them

## Decisions Log
| Date       | Decision | Rationale |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-22 | Initial design system created | Created by /design-consultation based on product context, competitive research (Warp, Zed, Railway, Ghostty, Cursor, Linear), and analysis of existing website |
| 2026-03-22 | Satoshi over Inter for display | Inter is the default for every dev tool since 2020. Satoshi has the same geometric clarity with distinctive letterforms that give BOA typographic personality. |
| 2026-03-22 | DM Sans for body over Inter | Clean, great tabular numerals, not overused. Pairs naturally with Satoshi's geometry. |
| 2026-03-22 | Teal accent replaces sky blue | Sky blue (#0ea5e9) was Tailwind's default. Teal (#0d9488) ties directly to the logo's agent nodes and creates better complementary tension with amber. |
| 2026-03-22 | Left-aligned editorial hero layout | Breaks from the centered-everything pattern that makes dev tool sites interchangeable. Reads as authoritative and intentional. |
| 2026-03-22 | Asymmetric feature grid | Uniform 3-column grids with colored icon circles are a generic pattern. Asymmetric cards with a featured item create visual hierarchy. |
| 2026-03-22 | Monospace section labels throughout | JetBrains Mono at 11px for labels, version badges, and metadata reinforces terminal-native identity without being heavy-handed. |
| 2026-03-22 | Empire theme as new TUI default | Phosphor's lime green reads as "hacker." Empire uses the design system's amber/copper/teal palette for a professional feel. Phosphor stays as an option. |
| 2026-03-22 | Rounded borders in TUI | Sharp box-drawing corners feel dated. Rounded corners (╭╮╰╯) are the single highest-impact modernization for a ratatui app. |
| 2026-03-22 | Inner padding in TUI panels | 1 char horizontal padding prevents content from touching borders. Gives breathing room without sacrificing density. |
| 2026-03-22 | Single panel seam | Double-border between list and preview panels looks heavy. One shared divider line reads as a cohesive surface. |
| 2026-04-15 | Web dashboard diverges to Geist + neutral zinc | The web dashboard is a utility surface (sessions, terminals, diffs) not a brand surface. Warm copper at full saturation competes with terminal content and xterm ANSI colors. Geist + zinc surfaces let the content lead; brand amber stays as the accent for CTAs, focus rings, and the logo. See the Web Dashboard section below. |
| 2026-05-17 | Unified theme system across TUI and web | Issue #1189: the web dashboard's theme picker did nothing. Surface palette is now driven by the user's chosen `Theme` on both TUI and web via a server-side projection (`ResolvedTheme`); the "web deliberately diverges to neutral zinc" rule from 2026-04-15 is retired in favour of "Empire is the default but the user picks." Builtins moved to TOML (issue #1097) so adding a theme is a one-file drop. Geist typography on the dashboard is unchanged; only color is unified. |
| 2026-06-11 | Rename the `default` builtin theme to `zinc` | "default" read as "no theme chosen" rather than a specific look. Renamed to `zinc` (the neutral zinc + amber chrome) so the picker entry is self-describing in both the TUI and web. It stays the default: empty `theme.name` and the unknown-theme fallback both resolve to `zinc`. Migration v014 rewrites a stored `theme.name = "default"` to `"zinc"`. |
| 2026-05-18 | Split `default` and `empire` into two distinct builtins | The 2026-05-17 unification made Empire (slate navy + copper) the implicit default for both TUI and web. Users who had grown used to the prior web dashboard's neutral-zinc + amber chrome (the 2026-04-15 palette) were confused: cold-load painted zinc/amber from the `web/src/index.css` `@theme` build-time fallback, then `useResolvedTheme` flipped the page to Empire navy with no path back. The fix promotes the zinc + amber chrome to a real, named builtin (`default`) sitting alongside `empire`. Empty `theme.name` resolves to `default`; the picker exposes both as explicit options. Cold-load now matches the resolved palette (no FOUC). Empire remains the navy/copper baseline; default is the zinc/amber pick. |

## Theme system

The user's chosen theme is the source of truth for color on both the TUI and the web dashboard. Themes live as TOML files: builtins under `themes/builtin/*.toml` (embedded at compile time via `include_str!`); user-defined themes under `~/.agent-of-empires/themes/*.toml`. The canonical schema is the flat color palette in `src/tui/styles/themes.rs` (24 hex fields) plus two optional metadata fields: `appearance = "dark" | "light"` and `[syntax].shiki_theme = "..."`.

### Surfaces and projections

- **TUI** renders directly from the `Theme` struct via `src/tui/styles/themes.rs`. Every ratatui widget reads from the named fields (`background`, `border`, `text`, `accent`, `running`, ...).
- **Web dashboard** renders from a server-side projection (`ResolvedTheme` in `src/tui/styles/resolved.rs`) of the same `Theme`. The projection maps named TUI fields onto the Tailwind CSS variables the dashboard consumes (`--color-surface-900`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-status-running`, etc.) and derives a few shades (surface-950/850, brand ramp, ANSI 16 for the embedded terminal) from background luminance and the appearance flag. Light themes (Catppuccin Latte) invert the ramp direction so the dashboard reads correctly on light surfaces.
- **Embedded terminal** (`web/src/hooks/useTerminal.ts`) inherits `--term-*` CSS variables (background, foreground, cursor, ANSI 16) from the same projection. wterm reads CSS variables at draw time; the hook fires `term.resize(...)` on theme change so the live terminal repaints under the new palette without waiting for the next PTY byte.
- **Syntax highlighting** (Shiki) selects a bundled Shiki theme per BOA theme via `[syntax].shiki_theme`. Built-ins map to closely matching upstream Shiki themes (`empire` → `github-dark`, `dracula` → `dracula`, `catppuccin-latte` → `catppuccin-latte`, etc.); user themes default to `github-dark` / `github-light` by appearance.

### Compatibility

- Adding a built-in theme is a one-file drop: `themes/builtin/<name>.toml` + one entry in `BUILTIN_THEMES`. No per-theme Rust constructor, no per-theme test stamp-out.
- Existing custom TOML themes (`~/.agent-of-empires/themes/*.toml`) parse unchanged. The new optional metadata fields default to `None` / empty for custom themes that omit them; the server falls back to luminance classification and appearance-based syntax theme selection.
- The TOML schema does **not** declare ANSI 16 colors per theme; the resolver derives them from semantic fields (ANSI 1 = error, 2 = running, ...). An optional `[terminal]` override section is future work; v1 derives so user themes work without authoring 16 hexes.

### Marketing site (`website/`)

The marketing site has its own palette (the original warm-navy Empire-aligned ramp documented in the [Color](#color) section above). It is brand expression, not user surface, so the user's theme picker doesn't affect it.

## Web Dashboard subset

The web dashboard (`web/`) is a utility that sits between a developer and a terminal. It is dense, keyboard-driven, and deliberately quieter than the marketing site. Use these rules when editing anything under `web/`.

### Typography

- **Sans:** Geist Sans (400, 500, 600). Self-hosted from `/public/fonts/`. Replaces Satoshi + DM Sans in this surface only.
- **Mono:** Geist Mono (400, 500). Replaces JetBrains Mono in this surface only.
- **Why:** Geist Sans has a slightly narrower x-height and more humanist terminals than Satoshi, which reads better alongside live monospace terminal output. Keeping the sans and mono in the same family eliminates the mixed-voice feeling that Satoshi + JetBrains Mono produces at 13-14px UI sizes.
- Monospace is the workhorse for session names, paths, status glyphs, and keyboard hints. Sans is for modal headings and body copy only.

### Color

- **All color** comes from the user's chosen theme via the resolved theme projection (see [Theme system](#theme-system)). The dashboard does not pin its own palette; the build-time defaults in `web/src/index.css` exist only as a cold-load fallback before `useResolvedTheme` fetches and applies the user's selection, and are kept in sync with the `zinc` builtin so the cold-load paint matches the post-fetch paint.
- **Zinc and Empire are two distinct builtins.** `zinc` (formerly named `default`) is neutral-zinc surfaces + amber chrome (the prior 2026-04-15 dashboard look, promoted to a real theme as of 2026-05-18, renamed 2026-06-11). `empire` is warm-navy surfaces + copper chrome (the 2026-03-22 design-system palette). `zinc` is the default: empty `theme.name` resolves to it and the unknown-theme fallback returns it; the picker exposes both. Tailwind utilities like `bg-surface-900`, `text-text-primary`, `text-status-running` resolve to whichever theme the user has selected.
- **Light theme support.** Catppuccin Latte is a first-class theme on both TUI and web. The projection inverts the surface ramp direction for light backgrounds and sets `color-scheme: light` on the root so native form controls render correctly.
- **Status colors** (running, waiting, warning, fresh-idle, idle, error, starting, stopped) come from the matching TUI semantic fields. `warning` aliases `waiting`; `starting` and `stopped` have no TUI equivalent, so the projection derives them by darkening `waiting` and `dimmed` respectively.
- **Text contrast.** Every text token in the ramp (`text-primary` through `text-dim`) must clear WCAG AA body contrast (4.5:1) against the surfaces body copy lives on. Builtins are tuned for AA; custom themes are the user's responsibility.

### Density and motion

- Row heights: 28-32px. Buttons: 32-40px. The dashboard is denser than the marketing site on purpose.
- Border radii: `rounded-md` (6px) for inline affordances, `rounded-lg` (8px) for panels and dialogs. No `rounded-xl` or larger in the dashboard.
- Motion: `animate-fade-in` and `animate-slide-up` are the only named transitions. Prefer `transition-colors` for hover/focus. Avoid scaling, parallax, or layered motion.

### What stays per-surface

- Font families (Geist on the dashboard, Satoshi/DM Sans on marketing).
- Density (denser on the dashboard than on the marketing site).
- Motion (minimal-functional on both; no decorative motion in the dashboard).

### What to avoid

- **No hardcoded chrome colors.** Use semantic tokens (`bg-surface-900`, `text-status-running`, `border-surface-700`). Hardcoded hex / rgb / `bg-[#...]` arbitrary classes don't repaint under theme changes. The few existing exceptions are: brand-mark SVGs in `Dashboard.tsx` (these stay brand amber regardless of theme), `lib/ansi.ts` (renders user-produced ANSI escape content, not chrome).
- **Fixed Tailwind palette exceptions stay narrow.** Palette utilities like green, amber, rose, and sky may remain for status, severity, syntax, user-authored content, or third-party visualizations where the hue is the payload. Non-status dashboard chrome should use semantic tokens or add a `ResolvedTheme` token first.
- **No new build-time `@theme [data-theme=...]` blocks.** The runtime palette swap goes through CSS variables on `documentElement`; build-time scoped themes can't support user-defined TOML themes without rebuilds.

If a change to `web/` would require deviating from any of the above, update this section first.
