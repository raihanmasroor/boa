//! Plugin manifest and capability types for the Agent of Empires plugin system.
//!
//! This crate is the stable surface a plugin author (and the in-tree host)
//! compiles against: the `aoe-plugin.toml` manifest schema, the capability
//! taxonomy, and the validation rules that gate a manifest before any of its
//! contributions are registered. The host side (registries, JSON-RPC worker
//! protocol, capability grants) lives in the main crate and lands in later
//! phases; see `docs/development/internals/plugin-system.md` for the design.
