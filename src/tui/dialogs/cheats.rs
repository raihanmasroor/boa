//! Age of Empires cheat-code easter eggs for the TUI command palette.
//!
//! A hidden easter egg. Mirrors the web registry
//! (`web/src/lib/cheats.ts`); the two are hand-kept parallel since Rust and
//! TypeScript can't share a literal. The TUI surfaces only the toast message
//! (via `Action::SetTransientStatus`), not the web's visual flourishes.

/// Cheat code (already normalized: lowercase, single-spaced) to the transient
/// message shown when the user types it into the command palette.
