//! Tips engine: a small registry of "did you know" hints surfaced in the UI.
//!
//! This module is pure data plus selection logic, with no rendering or I/O, so
//! every surface renders from one catalog. The TUI consumes it today; because
//! it lives in the shared lib (not under `tui`), the `serve` server can expose
//! the same catalog to the web dashboard later with no rework.
//!
//! Two kinds of tips:
//! - **Rotation** tips are always eligible and surface passively (the badge +
//!   the tips list). They never interrupt.
//! - **Earned** tips become eligible only once a behavior signal fires, and may
//!   pop once on their own, so a hint shows up exactly when it would help.
//!
//! Seen state lives in `config.app_state.tips_seen` and the on/off preference
//! in `config.session.show_tips`, so both are shared across surfaces and
//! survive restarts.

/// Behavior signals an earned tip's trigger can inspect. Sourced from
/// `config.app_state`; add a field here when a new earned tip needs a new
/// signal.
