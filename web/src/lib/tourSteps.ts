// Declarative source of truth for the first-run interactive tutorial.

// This module is intentionally framework/engine-independent: it knows nothing
// about react-joyride. Steps are described as plain data keyed by typed anchor
// ids, and a single `tourAnchor()` helper is the only sanctioned way to attach
// an anchor to a DOM node. The CI drift guard (tourSteps.test.ts) relies on that
// convention: every anchor must be referenced through `TOUR_ANCHORS.<key>`, never
// as a raw `data-tour="..."` literal, so a renamed or deleted anchor fails fast.
