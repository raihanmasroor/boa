/**
 * Whether a diff-list file selection has gone stale and should be cleared.
 *
 * A selection is stale when it is a plain diff-list pick (not opened from a
 * transcript link) whose path is no longer present in the current diff files.
 * Cited files (opened from a `path:line` transcript link) are exempt: they may
 * have no diff against the base and stay viewable via the full-file fallback
 * (#1810). Produced-file views (opened from the Files pane or an image/PDF
 * chat link, `view: true`) are likewise exempt: they render the file itself,
 * not a diff, so they are expected to be absent from the diff list. Path and
 * repo are matched together so a same-path file in another workspace repo
 * can't keep a selection alive.
