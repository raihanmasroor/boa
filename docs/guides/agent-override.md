# Agent Command Overrides

The "Agent Command Override" feature lets you define alternative commands/scripts for agents supported by `boa`. This
can be useful for running with specific options (though this can also be done using "Agent Extra Args"), via a script,
or under a sandbox such as [nono](https://github.com/always-further/nono/).

## Configuring an override

### Via the TUI

The "Agent Command Override" setting can be found under the "Agents" setting group.

You can define a command override on a per-agent basis using the format:

```
<agent>=<cmd>
```

For instance, to define an override to launch OpenCode using `nono` as a sandbox:

```
opencode=nono run --profile opencode-dev --allow-cwd -- opencode
```

### Via the config

Similarly, agent command overrides can also be added to your `boa` config at the global, profile, or repo level:

```toml
[session.agent_command_override]
opencode = "my-opencode-command"
```

### Via the CLI

Finally, an agent command override can also be used via the CLI using the `boa add` command:

```
boa add --cmd-override <CMD_OVERRIDE>
```

A configured override also applies to plain `boa add --cmd <agent>` (without `--cmd-override`): the agent name
resolves through `agent_command_override` just as it does in the TUI. This means the override is honored consistently
whether the session is started from the TUI, a terminal CLI session, or an structured-view session. The on-PATH check that
`boa add` runs before creating the session verifies the resolved override binary, so a session works even when only the
wrapper (for example `opencode-plannotator`) is installed and the bare agent binary (`opencode`) is not.

### Via the web dashboard

The new-session wizard previews the exact command a session will launch.
Under "More options", the agent section shows the resolved command beneath
the "Command override" field, post-override and post-arg-resolution; for a
structured view session this is the ACP registry command plus its args (for
example `opencode acp`, or `opencode-plannotator acp` once an override is
set), not the bare binary. Type in the "Command override" field to set the
per-session command override; the registry args are appended automatically
and never duplicated. Note that extra args are ignored for structured view
sessions; use the command override to change a structured view launch
command.

## Priority order

As mentioned in the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md), `boa` uses a layered configuration system. As such,
settings such as agent-command override are evaluated in the following priority order:

1. Per-session - passed via `boa add --cmd-override` in the CLI
2. Repo override - configured in the repo project-root config
3. Profile override - configured in the profile config
4. Global override - configured in the global config

## Shell support

When running an agent command override, `boa` attempts to use the user's `$SHELL`. However, it will default to `bash`
if:

- `$SHELL` is not set, or
- The shell is non-POSIX (`fish`, `nu`, `nushell`, `pwsh`, `powershell`)

If running a non-POSIX shell where you have defined your wrapper/command as a script, abbreviation, alias, etc, it is
advisable to either write a bash script for your override, or define it directly in `boa`.
