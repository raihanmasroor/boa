# Settings & Profiles

The settings view mirrors the TUI settings layout so muscle memory
carries over. It is grouped into tabs you can edit per profile or
globally. This page maps the tabs and covers the web-only pieces:
the profile picker, connected-device tracking, and step-up elevation.
For running the server, see the [Web Dashboard overview](../web-dashboard.md).

## Tab groups

Settings are organized into the same groups as the TUI:

- **Appearance**: Theme.
- **Sessions**: Session defaults and Structured view (the replay and watchdog
  tuning knobs; see [Structured View Internals](../../development/internals/structured-view.md#global-tuning-acp)).
- **Environment**: Sandbox, Worktree, and Tmux.
- **Notifications**: Sound and Notifications (web push; see
  [Push notifications](../../push-notifications.md)).
- **Web Dashboard**: Terminal, Security, and Connected Devices.
- **System**: Updates and Logging.

Every config field that exists in the TUI settings is editable here too: the
panel is generated from the same settings schema as the TUI, so a field
declared once appears on both surfaces and they never drift. The only host-side
knob the dashboard does not surface is the host environment list, which stays
TUI/`config.toml`-only.

## Profiles

The profile picker switches the active profile and scopes which
settings you are editing. Each profile carries its own session defaults,
sandbox / worktree config, and overrides; global settings apply when a
profile does not override a field. Creating, renaming, deleting, or
changing the default profile is a gated action (see Step-up elevation
below).

## Connected devices

Under **Web Dashboard > Connected Devices**, the dashboard lists every
signed-in login session as a device, with a browser and OS label parsed
from the user agent, the origin IP, and a relative "last seen" time. The
session you are using is labeled "this device". The list polls every ten
seconds and refreshes when you return to the tab, so a device that just
signed in (or went quiet) shows up without a manual reload. This is the
surface for spotting an unexpected session.

Each other device has a **Revoke** button that ends just that session,
and **Sign out all devices** signs every device out at once (including
this one). Both are step-up actions: the first click after a fresh page
load surfaces the passphrase prompt (see Step-up elevation below).

Sessions are persisted to an owner-only file under the app dir, so they
survive a `boa serve` restart: signed-in devices stay signed in across
a daemon bounce (config edit, `boa update`, crash) instead of being
re-prompted for the passphrase. Changing the passphrase drops every
persisted session. To opt out and force re-authentication on every
restart, turn off **Persist login sessions** under Web Dashboard, or set
`auth.persist_sessions = false` in `config.toml`.

## Step-up elevation

When passphrase login is configured, day-to-day actions (sending prompts, resolving approvals, switching mode) never re-prompt. Editing persisted config is different: saving the global settings panel, creating / deleting / renaming a profile, editing a profile, or changing the default profile requires that your login session was elevated within the last 15 minutes via `POST /api/login/elevate`. The first such action after a page load surfaces an inline passphrase prompt; subsequent edits inside the window go through without re-prompting.

This narrow gate covers the persisted-tamper attack (a stolen session planting a malicious Docker image, worktree template, or profile) without friction on the conversation surface.

Browsers on the same host as the daemon (localhost) never see the prompt: a same-host caller already passes the filesystem trust boundary and could run the equivalent CLI command with no passphrase, so the gate only applies to remote callers.
