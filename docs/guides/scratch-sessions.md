# Scratch sessions

A scratch session is a session that does not belong to any project on
disk. When you start one, BOA provisions a fresh directory under
`~/.agent-of-empires/scratch/<id>/` (on Linux:
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-of-empires/scratch/<id>/`), attaches the
session to it, and removes the directory when you delete the session
(unless you opt in to keeping it).

Use scratch sessions for one-off questions, quick investigations, or
ad-hoc agent runs where you do not want a session record tied to a
specific repo or to keep stray files around afterwards.

## When to use it

* Ask the agent a question that does not depend on a particular codebase.
* Give the agent a clean, empty directory to write files into without polluting an existing project.
* Investigate something quickly and have the directory go away automatically when you are done.

## Three ways to start one

### Command line

```bash
boa add --scratch -t "Quick question" -c claude
```

The session prints its resolved `Path:` line pointing at
`~/.agent-of-empires/scratch/<id>/` and a `Scratch: yes` line in the
summary. You do not pass a project path; it is provisioned for you.

Trying to pass a path alongside `--scratch` is rejected:

```bash
boa add /Users/me/repo --scratch
# error: Cannot specify a project path with --scratch
```

`--scratch` is mutually exclusive with all worktree-related flags
(`-w`, `--new-branch`, `--base-branch`, `--repo`, `--project`,
`--no-submodules`). Mixing them fails at parse time with a clear
conflict message.

### Web dashboard

In the new-session wizard, the **Project** section has a toggle labeled
**Skip project folder** above the Recent / Browse / Clone URL tabs.
Turning it on hides the path picker and shows a "Scratch session"
callout; the worktree controls under **More options** become
unavailable.

Selecting a real project (Recent / Browse / Clone) turns the toggle
back off, so the wizard never submits a request with both a real path
and the scratch flag set.

**Fast-create shortcut.** From anywhere in the dashboard, press
`Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Linux / Windows) to open the
wizard with scratch already enabled. A follow-up `Cmd+Enter` /
`Ctrl+Enter` launches the session, so two keystrokes is enough to spin
up a fresh scratch session.

**Command palette.** The same flow is reachable from the command
palette (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`): search for "New scratch session" and
run it to open the wizard prefilled for a scratch session. In
read-only mode the creation commands are hidden from the palette.

**Sidebar grouping.** Every scratch session has its own
`scratch/<id>/` directory on disk, so the dashboard sidebar would
otherwise render each one as its own one-session group. Scratch
sessions are bucketed into a single synthetic **Scratch** group at
the bottom of the sidebar instead, mirroring how multi-repo
workspaces are collapsed into one **Multi-repo** group. Clicking the
"+" on the Scratch group header opens the wizard with no path
prefilled, so you can flip on **Skip project folder** to add another
one.

### TUI new-session dialog

Press `Ctrl+T` from any field in the new-session dialog. The Path
input is replaced with a `(scratch directory)` marker, the worktree
toggle is forced off, and submitting creates the session in a fresh
scratch directory. The bottom hint line surfaces `Ctrl+T scratch` so
the binding is always visible; the chip is emphasized when you are
focused on the Path row. Press `Ctrl+T` again to revert.

## Storage location

Scratch directories live under the app data dir, each session in its own `<instance-id>/` subdirectory:

| Platform | Scratch root |
| --- | --- |
| macOS / Windows | `~/.agent-of-empires/scratch/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-of-empires/scratch/` (defaults to `~/.config/agent-of-empires/scratch/`) |

Storing under the app dir (rather than `$TMPDIR`) means scratch directories survive OS-level temp-dir cleaning until you delete the session.

## What happens at delete

Deleting a scratch session (`boa rm`, web dashboard, or TUI delete dialog) also removes its scratch directory.

Pass `--keep-scratch` to `boa rm` (or check the box in the delete dialog) to keep the directory on disk; the session is detached from BOA's view but the files survive, and the kept path is logged.

Deleted scratch directories do not appear in the wizard's **Recent projects** tab.

## Compatibility

* **Structured view**: scratch sessions use the structured view (the default) with the
  bundled ACP agents. The ACP worker spawns with the scratch
  directory as its current working directory.
* **Sandboxes**: scratch sessions can run in a container sandbox
  (`-s` or `--sandbox-image`); the container mounts the scratch
  directory the same way it mounts a real project path.
* **Worktrees**: not supported. A scratch directory is not a git
  repo, so the worktree concept does not apply. Use a regular project
  path with `-w` if you want a worktree.
* **Hooks**: a scratch directory has no `.agent-of-empires/config.toml`,
  so the per-repo hook trust prompt never fires. Global and profile
  `on_create` hooks still run, with the scratch directory as their
  `cwd`.

## Cleanup and retention

If `boa serve` (or your shell session) dies before you delete a scratch session, the directory is left on disk. There is no automatic retention policy yet; clean up by deleting the session record (which removes the directory) or by removing entries under the scratch root directly.

To keep the files, use `boa rm --keep-scratch` and copy them out, or create a new session against a real path with `boa add <path>`.
