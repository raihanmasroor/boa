# Forking Sessions

Forking a session starts a new, independent BOA session from an existing session's conversation context, so you can take the same history in a different direction. The original session and its transcript are left untouched.

To branch a conversation into a new session rather than continuing the same one in place, fork it. (To continue the same conversation, see [Session Resume](./session-resume.md).)

## How to fork

### TUI

Open the command palette and run **Fork session (resume context, diverge)**, or right-click a session row and choose **Fork session**. There is no keyboard shortcut by design; the palette and the context menu are the two entry points.

The new-session dialog opens prefilled with the source session's working directory and group, with the title defaulted to `<name> (fork)`. Adjust anything you like, then create the session.

### Web dashboard

Open a session's context menu in the sidebar and choose **Fork session**. The option appears for forkable structured sessions.

### CLI

Pass `--fork-from` with the source session's id or title:

```sh
boa add --fork-from <session-id-or-title>
```

This creates a terminal session that resumes the source's conversation and then runs independently.

The fork inherits the parent's agent by default, so you normally omit `--tool` / `--cmd`. If you do pass one, it must match the parent's agent: a captured conversation is agent-specific, so forking a Claude session as Codex is rejected rather than run against the wrong agent. Because a fork must run in the parent's working directory and filesystem to resolve the prior conversation, `--fork-from` cannot be combined with `--worktree` / `--new-branch`, `--sandbox` / `--sandbox-image`, or a `--cmd` that already carries its own `--resume` flags.

## What gets inherited

The fork inherits:

- The parent's conversation context, which the fork resumes from.
- The working directory. This is required so the agent can resolve the prior conversation, so the fork runs in the same directory.
- The group.
- The tool (agent).

From there the fork diverges as its own session: it has its own id, shows up separately in the session list, and survives restarts independently of the parent.

## The original is untouched

Forking only reads the parent's conversation. The parent session and its transcript are never modified, so you end up with two independent sessions: the original, exactly as it was, and the new fork.

## Which agents support forking

Forking needs an agent that can branch a conversation:

- **Terminal sessions**: claude, codex, and opencode.
- **Structured (ACP) sessions**: the Claude adapter (`claude-agent-acp`).

Resume-only agents (such as gemini, vibe, kiro, qwen, and copilot) and non-resuming agents (such as cursor and droid) cannot fork. For those, the Fork option is hidden or refused.

## Fork vs. resume

Resume continues the same conversation in place; fork branches it into a new, separate one. For resuming a session's own conversation, see [Session Resume](./session-resume.md).
