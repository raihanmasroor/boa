# Multi-Repo Workspaces

Run a single BOA session across several git repositories at once. Each repo gets its own worktree on a shared branch name, all rooted under one workspace directory, attached to one tmux session.

Use this when a unit of work, a feature, a bug fix, an investigation, touches more than one repo and you want one agent driving all of them, not N agents you have to mentally reconcile.

## When to Use

| Scenario | Multi-repo? |
|---|---|
| Bug spans backend and frontend repos | Yes |
| Refactor across an OSS core and a private wrapper | Yes |
| Feature limited to a single repo | No, regular session |
| Investigating logs that touch many repos | Yes, agent picks the relevant ones |
| OSS core is pinned and rarely changes | Use [`on_create` hooks](repo-config.md) instead |

## Quick Start

### 1. Register your repos once

```bash
boa project add /path/to/backend
boa project add /path/to/frontend
boa project add /path/to/shared-lib
```

`boa project list` shows what is registered.

### 2. Start a multi-repo session

CLI:

```bash
boa add /path/to/backend \
  --project frontend \
  --project shared-lib \
  -w feat/auth-rewrite -b
```

TUI: open the new-session dialog (`n`), enter the worktree branch, focus the **Extra Repos** field, press `Ctrl+R`, and pick the registered projects you want to include.

Web: `+ New session`, pick a primary repo, then click registered projects in the **Extra repos** picker (or paste a path with the free-text input).

Worktree creation across the repos in a workspace runs concurrently, so wall-clock time is roughly that of the slowest single repo rather than the sum (network-bound `git fetch` and `git submodule update` dominate). If any repo's post-checkout hook fails after `git worktree add` has already checked out the branch, the workspace is still created and the hook output is surfaced as a warning. See [Post-Checkout Hooks](worktrees.md#post-checkout-hooks) for details.

### 3. The agent sees one workspace

The session starts in the workspace root with all the worktrees as siblings:

```
~/aoe-workspaces/feat-auth-rewrite/
├── backend/      ← branch feat/auth-rewrite
├── frontend/     ← branch feat/auth-rewrite
└── shared-lib/   ← branch feat/auth-rewrite
```

The agent navigates between them like any normal multi-repo working tree. Use `cd` and standard git commands; BOA does not impose any cross-repo orchestration.

## The Project Registry

Saved repo paths the multi-repo pickers draw from. Two scopes:

| Scope | File | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| Global | `<app_dir>/projects.json` | Every profile |
| Profile | `<app_dir>/profiles/{profile}/projects.json` | Only that profile |

`<app_dir>` is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-of-empires/` on Linux, `~/.agent-of-empires/` on macOS.

`boa project add <path>` defaults to global; `boa -p <profile> project add <path>` defaults to profile. Pass `--scope global` or `--scope profile` to override.

Adding a path that already exists in another scope is an error unless you pass `--allow-override`, which lets a profile entry shadow the global one (the profile entry then wins in merged views):

```bash
boa project add /repo/foo                              # global
boa -p other project add /repo/foo --allow-override    # profile shadows global
```

### Saved projects versus pinned projects

A registered (saved) project is a registry entry: it shows in the Projects view and the new-session wizard's multi-select picker, whether or not it has any sessions. Pinning is a separate decision: it keeps the project's header visible in the sidebar / project view even with zero sessions. So a saved project is not forced into the sidebar, and unpinning a project does not delete it; it stays saved and only its sessionless header goes away. Removing a project (the Projects view's "Remove", or `boa project remove`) is the one action that deletes the registry entry.

### Pinning a project from the TUI

In the TUI's project view (press `g` and pick Project grouping), a project header normally disappears once its last session is gone. Press `p` on a project header, or pick "Pin project" from its right-click menu, to pin it (registering the repo in the global registry if it is not already saved). A pinned project keeps its header (marked with a `◆`) even with zero sessions, so you can launch new work under it later. Press `p` again to unpin; the project stays saved (still in the picker), and its header drops from the view once it has no sessions.

### Pinning a project from the web dashboard

The web sidebar's project (repository) grouping mirrors the TUI. A pinned project shows a `◆` next to its name and keeps its header even with zero sessions; its `+` New session button launches work under that repo. Open a project header's actions menu (right-click, or the menu on the header) and choose "Pin project" to pin it (registering the repo, global scope, if needed) or "Unpin project" to clear the pin while keeping the saved project. Pinned-but-empty projects sort below your active repositories. The pin is stored in the registry, so a pin made in the TUI shows up here when the dashboard regains focus, and vice versa.

## CLI Reference

```bash
# List
boa project list                       # merged (global + active profile)
boa project list --scope global        # globals only
boa project list --scope profile       # active profile only
boa project list --json                # machine-readable

# Add
boa project add /path/to/repo                          # global, name = basename
boa project add /path/to/repo --name shortname        # custom display name
boa project add /path/to/repo --scope profile         # profile-only
boa project add /path/to/repo --allow-override        # shadow other-scope entry

# Remove
boa project remove backend                # by name (case-insensitive)
boa project remove /path/to/repo          # by canonical path
boa project remove backend --scope profile

# Use in a session
boa add /path/to/primary --project name1 --project name2 -w branch -b
boa add /path/to/primary --repo /literal/path --project registered -w branch -b
```

`--repo` and `--project` may be mixed; the union is passed to the workspace builder. The builder rejects duplicate repo names, so the same repo via two paths is a hard error.

`boa list --json` includes a `workspace_repos` array for each session; the array is empty for single-repo sessions.

## TUI

From the home view, press `b` (or `B` with strict hotkeys) to open a filterable picker over the merged registry. Selecting a project opens the new-session dialog pre-filled with that project's path. The same action is available from the `Ctrl+K` command palette ("New session from saved project"). With no registered projects, the picker is replaced by a "No Projects" prompt pointing at `boa project add`.

## Web Dashboard

The Projects page (folder icon in the sidebar footer) is full CRUD over the registry: add, remove, switch scope, opt into `allow_override`. Read-only servers (`boa serve --read-only`) hide the destructive controls.

The new-session wizard surfaces the registry as toggleable chips in the Project section. The free-text input still works for paths that aren't registered.

Multi-repo sessions are bucketed into a single **Multi-repo** group at the bottom of the sidebar, regardless of which repo was chosen as the primary. Each session row shows a chip per repo under the title.

## Limitations

- **One branch name per workspace**: every repo gets the same `-w <branch>` value.
- **No agent-driven repo pull-in mid-session**: to add a repo, start a new session.
- **No saved workspace templates**: each session picks the repo set fresh.
- **No per-repo PR tracking**: coordinated PR workflow happens outside BOA.
