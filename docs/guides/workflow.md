# Workflow Guide

This guide covers the recommended setup and daily workflow for using `boa` with git worktrees.

## Project Setup: Bare Git Repos

The recommended setup is a "bare repo" structure, keeping the main repository and all worktrees under one directory:

```
my-project/
  .bare/               # Bare git repository
  .git                 # File pointing to .bare
  main/                # Worktree for main branch
  feat-api/            # Worktree for feature branch
  fix-bug/             # Another worktree
```

### Initial Setup

**From the web dashboard:**

When creating a new session, go to the "Clone URL" tab, enter the repository URL, expand "Advanced", and check "Clone as bare repository". This performs the setup automatically and returns the path to the main worktree.

**From the command line:**

```bash
git clone --bare git@github.com:user/repo.git my-project/.bare
cd my-project
echo "gitdir: ./.bare" > .git
git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
git fetch origin
git worktree add main main
```

Run `boa` from `my-project/` and new worktrees are created as siblings (e.g. `my-project/feat-api/`) rather than in a separate directory.

Bare repos keep all paths within the project root (required for Docker sandboxing) and let you switch branches by switching directories.

## Single-Window Workflow

Run `boa` in a single terminal and toggle between views:

| Key | View | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| (default) | Structured View | Manage and interact with AI coding agents |
| `t` | Terminal View | Access paired terminals for git, builds, tests |

### Daily Workflow

**1. Start your day**

```bash
cd ~/scm/my-project
boa
```

You'll see your sessions in Structured View. Keep one session on `main` for general questions and pulling updates.

**2. Update main** (Terminal View)

- Press `t` to switch to Terminal View
- Select your main session, press `Enter` to attach to its terminal
- Run `git pull origin main`
- Detach with `Ctrl+b d`
- Press `t` to return to Structured View

**3. Create a new session**

- Press `n` to open the new session dialog
- Enter a session title, for example `Auth Refactor`
- Enable Worktree if it is not already checked
- Press `Enter`

This creates:
- A new branch derived from the title, for example `auth-refactor`
- A new worktree using that branch name
- A new session with an agent working in that worktree

To override the generated name, focus Worktree and press `Ctrl+P`, then fill in `Name`.

**4. Work on your feature** (Structured View)

- Select your session and press `Enter` to attach
- Interact with the agent
- Detach with `Ctrl+b d` when done

**5. Run builds/tests** (Terminal View)

- Press `t` to switch to Terminal View
- Select the same session, press `Enter`
- Run your build commands, tests, git operations
- Detach with `Ctrl+b d`

**6. Clean up when done**

- In Structured View, select the session and press `d` to delete
- Answer `Y` to also remove the worktree

## Tips

- **Keep one session on main**: Use it for codebase questions and its terminal for `git pull`
- **One task, one session**: Each worktree maps to one BOA session. Keeps context isolated.
- **Pull before creating**: Always update main before creating new sessions so branches start fresh
- **Let agents stay focused**: Git operations happen in the paired terminal, not in agent sessions

## Keyboard Reference

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `t` | Toggle between Structured View and Terminal View |
| `D` | Open [Diff View](diff-view.md) to review git changes |
| `Enter` | Attach to agent (Structured View) or terminal (Terminal View) |
| `n` | Create new session |
| `d` | Delete session (Structured View only) |
| `?` | Show help |
| `Ctrl+b d` | Detach from tmux (return to BOA) |

## Non-Bare Repos

If you're not using a bare repo setup, BOA defaults to creating worktrees in a sibling directory:

```
~/scm/
  my-project/              # Your repo (stays on main)
  my-project-worktrees/    # Worktrees created here
    feat-auth-refactor/
    fix-bug/
```

You can customize this with `path_template` in your config. See the [Worktrees Reference](worktrees.md) for details.
