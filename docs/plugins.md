# Plugins

Band of Agents keeps its core small (sessions, tmux, worktrees) and grows a
plugin system so optional capabilities can be enabled or disabled at runtime
instead of bloating the core. The core ships first-party plugins bundled with
the binary and can install external community plugins from GitHub or a local
directory. Per-plugin settings and plugin-contributed UI land in follow-up
releases; running plugin code is not wired up yet, so an installed external
plugin records its grant and files but does not execute until a later release.

To build your own, start with [Writing Plugins](development/writing-plugins.md)
and the [Plugin API Reference](plugin-api.md). The official starter scaffolds a
working plugin in Python, Node, or Rust:

```sh
cookiecutter gh:agent-of-empires/plugin-template
```

## Managing plugins

Three equivalent surfaces:

- **CLI**: `boa plugin list`, `boa plugin info <id>`, `boa plugin enable <id>`,
  `boa plugin disable <id>`, `boa plugin install <source>`,
  `boa plugin update <id>`, `boa plugin uninstall <id>`.
- **TUI**: open the command palette and run "Manage plugins", or open Settings
  and select the Plugins tab (the same manager, hosted inline). Space toggles
  enable/disable.
- **Web dashboard**: Settings, then the Plugins tab. The same list and toggles.
  Enabling or disabling a plugin requires an elevated (passphrase) session when
  login is enabled and is blocked in read-only mode; localhost browsers skip
  the passphrase step, matching the CLI's same-host trust model.

A plugin's enable-state is stored under `[plugins."<id>"]` in `config.toml` and
survives every config save.

## Bundled plugins

| Plugin | What it does | Disabled behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `boa.web` | The web dashboard management marker. Present whenever the dashboard is compiled in (`--features serve`), so every released binary ships it, enabled by default. | `boa serve` refuses to start until re-enabled (`boa plugin enable boa.web`). |

`boa.web` is the only bundled plugin today, and it rides along with the web
dashboard. So a release binary (or any `cargo build --features serve`) shows it
in `boa plugin list`, while a TUI-only build (`cargo build`, no `serve`) has an
empty registry and `boa plugin list` reports no plugins. That is expected, not a
bug.

The bundled set is deliberately minimal while the system is proven out. More
first-party plugins land as each piece is verified.

## Installing external plugins

External plugins are community code that you install at your own risk. Install
and uninstall are CLI-only (`boa plugin` is reserved for management); the TUI
and web surfaces show the result but do not install. Updating an already
installed plugin can be done from the CLI or approved in-app (see Trust and
capabilities below).

```sh
boa plugin install gh:owner/repo          # latest release (the audited default)
boa plugin install gh:owner/repo@v1.2.3   # an explicit tag, branch, or commit
boa plugin install ./path/to/plugin       # a local directory
boa plugin update <id>
boa plugin uninstall <id>
```

With no `@ref`, install resolves the repo's latest stable GitHub release (the
audited default path) and installs that tag. An explicit `@ref` installs
unverified, un-audited code and asks you to confirm first (`--yes` skips the
prompt). If the repo has published no release, install warns and falls back to
the default branch behind the same confirmation. The recorded source stays
ref-less, so `boa plugin update` keeps tracking the latest release; an `@ref`
install keeps following that ref.

A plugin lands under `<app_dir>/plugins/<id>/`. A GitHub source is cloned and
pinned to the exact commit; if the plugin ships a compiled worker as a release
binary, the asset for your platform is downloaded into the plugin directory. To
install from a GitHub Enterprise host, set `AOE_GITHUB_CLONE_BASE` to its base
URL.

### Trust and capabilities

Bundled plugins are `builtin` and fully trusted. Installed plugins are
`community` and untrusted: their manifest declares the capabilities they need
(network access, filesystem access, spawning processes, and so on), and install
prompts you once to grant that exact set. Run non-interactively with `--yes` to
grant without prompting. A capability this version of BOA does not recognize is
rejected rather than granted; upgrade BOA.

A grant is pinned to the installed manifest. If an update expands what the
plugin can do (new capabilities, changed build steps or UI slots, a runtime or
trust change), it must be approved before the new version becomes active. You
can approve in a terminal with `boa plugin update <id>`, or in-app: the web
dashboard's plugin settings and the TUI plugin manager show an Update action
that opens an approval popup describing exactly what changed. Declining keeps
the current version active and stops the prompt from reappearing until the next
version. The approval is pinned to the exact fetched content, so an update that
changed since you reviewed it is refused rather than applied. `BOA plugin
install` and `BOA plugin update` report the resolved trust level (`featured`,
`community`, or `local`) in their success output, and `boa plugin list` and
`boa plugin info <id>` show each plugin's trust level and whether it is granted.
An external plugin cannot use the reserved `boa.*` /
`agent-of-empires.*` id namespace.

Resolved versions live in `<app_dir>/plugins.lock` (the exact commit, manifest
hash, and release asset per plugin), so an install is reproducible.

Running plugin code, per-plugin settings, and plugin-contributed UI land in
follow-up releases.
