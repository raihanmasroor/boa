A session manager for AI coding agents on Linux and macOS, built on tmux and written in Rust.

BOA runs multiple AI agents in parallel, each in its own tmux session, optionally on its own git branch, optionally inside a Docker container. Use the **TUI dashboard** in your terminal, or the **web dashboard** from any browser on any device.

## Why BOA?

Running several AI coding agents in parallel across tasks or branches means juggling terminal windows, git branches, and container lifecycles by hand. BOA handles it for you:

- **Two ways to use it.** A TUI for the terminal, or a web dashboard you can open in any browser, even on your phone. Same sessions, same data.
- **One dashboard for all agents.** See status (running, waiting, idle, error) at a glance. Toggle to paired shell terminals with `t`.
- **Git worktrees built in.** Create a session and BOA creates a branch + worktree automatically. Delete the session and BOA cleans up.
- **Docker sandboxing.** Run agents in isolated containers with your project mounted and auth credentials shared across containers.
- **Per-repo configuration.** Drop a `.agent-of-empires/config.toml` in your repo for project-specific settings and hooks that run on session creation or launch.
- **Sessions survive everything.** BOA wraps tmux, so agents keep running when you close the TUI, disconnect SSH, or your terminal crashes.
