# Quick Start

## Launch the TUI

```bash
boa
```

This opens the dashboard. You'll see an empty session list on first run.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | New session |
| `b` | New session from saved project |
| `p` | Manage saved projects (add/remove) |
| `Enter` | Attach to session |
| `d` | Delete session |
| `t` | Toggle Agent/Terminal view |
| `D` | Open diff view |
| `/` | Search sessions |
| `?` | Show help (full keymap) |
| `q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+b d` | Detach from tmux session |

Press `?` in the TUI for the full keymap.

## Create Your First Session

**From the TUI:** Press `n` to open the new session dialog. Fill in the path to your project (or leave it as `.` for the current directory) and press `Enter`.

**From the CLI:**

```bash
boa add /path/to/project
```

The session appears in the dashboard with status **Idle**.

## Projects and Groups

These two words show up around the dashboard and mean different things.

A **project** is a saved directory path, usually a git repository, that you register once so you can start sessions from it without retyping the path. It is a BOA registry entry, not a Claude Code project (which is tied to a directory by Claude itself). You do not have to register your repos; `n` and `boa add <path>` work on any path. Registering is only a convenience for repos you reach for often.

Add a project two ways:

```bash
boa project add /path/to/repo        # CLI
```

In the TUI, press `p` to open **Manage projects**, then `a` to add one. Once a project is registered, `b` starts a new session from it (this is why `b` reports "No Projects" until you have added at least one). See [Multi-Repo Workspaces](guides/multi-repo-workspaces.md#the-project-registry) for scopes and multi-repo sessions.

A **group** is unrelated to projects. It is a label you assign to existing sessions to sort them in the sidebar (for example `fix` and `feature`), set from the session rename dialog or with `boa group move`. Projects are where sessions start; groups are how sessions are bucketed once they exist. See the [Web Dashboard grouping section](guides/web/dashboard.md#sidebar-grouping-by-repo-by-group-or-both) for the grouping axes.

## Attach to a Session

Select a session and press `Enter` to attach. You're now inside a tmux session running your AI agent (Claude Code by default).

To return to the TUI, press **`Ctrl+b d`** (the standard tmux detach shortcut).

## Use the Terminal View

Press `t` to toggle between Structured View and Terminal View. Each agent session has a paired shell terminal where you can run builds, tests, and git commands without interrupting the agent.

## Review Changes with Diff View

Press `D` to open the diff view. This shows changes between your working directory and the base branch. Navigate files with `j`/`k`, press `e` to edit, and `Esc` to close.

## Create a Worktree Session

To work on a new branch with its own directory:

```bash
# CLI
boa add . -w feat/my-feature -b

# TUI: press n, enter a title, enable Worktree
# Optional: press Ctrl+P on Worktree and fill in Name
```

This creates a new git branch, a worktree directory, and a session pointing at it. When you delete the session, BOA offers to clean up the worktree too.

## Attach to Existing Work

**Attach to an existing branch or worktree.** Omit `-b` and BOA re-uses the worktree for that branch, or checks the branch out into a new worktree if none exists:

```bash
boa add . -w feat/my-feature
```

In the TUI, press `Ctrl+P` on the Worktree field and toggle **Attach to existing branch** (same toggle in the web wizard). Removing the session only cleans up worktrees BOA created; attached ones are left alone. See [Worktrees Reference](guides/worktrees.md) for the full matrix.

**Resume a Claude Code conversation.** After attaching, run `/resume` in the Claude pane and pick a conversation. BOA captures the session ID and persists it so the next launch reattaches automatically. See [Session Resume](guides/session-resume.md), including `boa session set-session-id` to set the Claude UUID explicitly.

## Create a Sandboxed Session

To run an agent inside a Docker container:

```bash
boa add --sandbox .
```

In the TUI, toggle the sandbox checkbox when creating a session. The agent runs in an isolated container with your project mounted at `/workspace` and authentication credentials shared via persistent Docker volumes.

Requires Docker to be installed.

## Choose a Different Agent

By default, BOA uses Claude Code. To use a different tool:

```bash
boa add -c opencode .   # or any other supported agent
```

In the TUI, select the tool from the dropdown in the new session dialog.

## Use the Web Dashboard

Prefer a browser? Run `boa serve` to start the web dashboard:

```bash
boa serve                         # localhost only
boa serve --host 0.0.0.0          # accessible from other devices (use with VPN)
boa serve --daemon                # run in background
```

Open the printed URL in any browser (phone, tablet, or another computer) for the same session list, live terminal streaming, and session controls. Install it as a PWA for an app-like experience. See the [Web Dashboard Guide](guides/web-dashboard.md) for details.
