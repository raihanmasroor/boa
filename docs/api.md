# HTTP API Reference

`boa serve` exposes a small HTTP API so external orchestrators (other
agents, MCP tools, CI scripts) can drive sessions without attaching to
a terminal. This page documents the orchestration endpoints. The web
dashboard uses the same API surface plus additional internal routes.

## Authentication

All endpoints require a token unless the server was started with
`--no-auth`. The token is the one printed by `boa serve` (or visible
in the TUI's Serve panel). Three transports are accepted:

| Transport | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Bearer header (recommended for clients) | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| Query parameter | `?token=<token>` |
| Cookie | `aoe_token=<token>` (set automatically by the dashboard) |

Read-only mode (`boa serve --read-only`) blocks every write endpoint
with `403 read_only`. Read endpoints work normally.

## POST /api/sessions/{id}/send

Type a message into the agent and press Enter, the same way the TUI's
send-message dialog and the `boa send` CLI do. Honors the per-agent
paste-burst delay (e.g. Codex needs ~150 ms between text and Enter so
its burst-detection window expires before Enter arrives).

**Request body** (JSON)

```json
{ "message": "review the diff and pick the smallest fix" }
```

`message` is sent literally. Newlines inside the string are sent as
shift-Enter (line break in the agent's input box) and a final Enter
submits the whole message.

**Responses**

| Status | Body | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | `{"sent": true}` | Keys delivered to the tmux pane |
| `400` | `{"error": "message_empty"}` | `message` is empty or whitespace-only |
| `400` | `{"error": "acp_mode_unsupported"}` | Session is structured-view/ACP mode and has no tmux pane |
| `403` | `{"error": "read_only"}` | Server is in read-only mode |
| `404` | `{"error": "not_found"}` | No session with that id |
| `409` | `{"error": "session_not_running"}` | Session exists but the tmux pane is gone |
| `409` | `{"error": "resume_failed", "message": "...", "resume_session_id": "..."}` | Auto-revive tried to resume a stored conversation, but the pane exited before BOA could prove the ID invalid. The ID is preserved for explicit retry or replacement. |
| `409` | `{"error": "session_transient", "status": "..."}` | Session is mid-lifecycle and cannot accept input yet |
| `500` | `{"error": "tmux_error"}` or `{"error": "internal"}` | Unexpected failure (logged server-side) |

Concurrent POSTs to the same `id` are serialized server-side, so two
orchestrators racing on the same session won't interleave keystrokes
inside the pane. Concurrent POSTs to *different* ids run in parallel.

**Example**

```bash
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"summarize the failing test"}' \
  "http://localhost:7777/api/sessions/abc123/send"
```

## GET /api/sessions/{id}/output

Snapshot of the session's tmux pane. Use this after `send` to read
what the agent printed back, or as a polling read-only view.

**Query parameters**

| Name | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lines` | `200` | Number of trailing lines to capture. Clamped to `1..=2000`. |
| `format` | `text` | `text` strips ANSI escape sequences. `ansi` returns the raw pane bytes (use this if your client renders color). |

**Responses**

| Status | Body | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | `{"id": "...", "lines": N, "format": "text", "content": "..."}` | Pane captured |
| `400` | `{"error": "format_invalid", "allowed": ["text", "ansi"]}` | `format` was something other than `text` or `ansi` |
| `404` | `{"error": "not_found"}` | No session with that id |
| `409` | `{"error": "session_not_running"}` | Session exists but the tmux pane is gone |
| `500` | `{"error": "tmux_error"}` or `{"error": "internal"}` | Unexpected failure |

`output` does not require write access, so it works under
`--read-only`.

**Example**

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AOE_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:7777/api/sessions/abc123/output?lines=80&format=text"
```

## Driving a session as a subagent

Together, `send` and `output` are the minimum primitive needed to run
a BOA session as a controlled subagent. A typical loop:

1. `POST /api/sessions/{id}/send` with the prompt.
2. Poll `GET /api/sessions/{id}/output` until the pane content
   stabilizes (no change between two reads spaced ~1 s apart) or the
   session list shows the session's `status` back at `Idle`.
3. Capture the trailing region of `content` as the agent's reply.

For long-running prompts, prefer polling status via
`GET /api/sessions` over polling `output`, then read `output` once
when status returns to `Idle`. Status transitions are also broadcast
to push subscribers if the dashboard's push notifications are
configured.
