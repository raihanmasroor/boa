# Modes, Approvals & Model Controls

The composer footer is where you steer a structured-view session: the permission mode decides what runs without asking, approval cards gate the rest, and model and reasoning-effort selectors tune the agent when the adapter advertises them. For the surrounding UI, see [Interface](interface.md).

## Permission modes and YOLO

A session runs in one of the modes its ACP adapter advertises. The mode picker shows whatever the agent reports; for `claude-agent-acp` the typical set is:

| Mode | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `default` | Every Write/Edit/Bash routes through an approval card. |
| `acceptEdits` | Edit-kind tools auto-approved; Bash and unknown tools still prompt. |
| `bypassPermissions` | All tools auto-approved (the YOLO mode). |
| `plan` | Read-only; the agent drafts a plan but runs no side-effectful tools. |

Other adapters report their own ids (Gemini's `auto_edit` and `yolo` map onto `acceptEdits` and `bypassPermissions`).

Turning on `[session] yolo_mode_default` (or the wizard's "Auto-approve actions" toggle) asks the adapter to start in `bypassPermissions`. This is best-effort: if the adapter accepts, the picker flips and approval cards stop; if it rejects, an amber notice appears and the session keeps running in whatever mode it landed on. `claude-agent-acp` only offers `bypassPermissions` when `boa serve` was launched with `ALLOW_BYPASS=1` in its environment; without it, use `acceptEdits` or approve as you go.

## Approvals

When the agent wants to run a tool that needs approval, the structured view shows a card:

- **Benign tools** (read, search, list): single tap.
- **Destructive tools** (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, writes to system paths): long-press 800ms with a confirmation ring; single tap is reserved for deny.

```toml
[acp]
approval_timeout_secs = 300              # a pending approval auto-cancels after this
destructive_require_double_confirm = true
```

The card clears as soon as your decision is accepted. If it already resolved on the daemon (a concurrent decision or a watchdog), resolving again clears it quietly instead of erroring.

## Questions (AskUserQuestion)

Some agents ask a structured question mid-turn rather than guessing. With `claude-agent-acp` this is the built-in `AskUserQuestion` tool; the daemon advertises the ACP form-elicitation capability so the agent surfaces it as a question card in the web dashboard. The same capability also lets an MCP server attached to the agent collect arbitrary structured input, which renders through the same card:

- **Single-choice** questions render as radio buttons, **multi-choice** as checkboxes, and each question carries its own free-text "Other" box so you can type an answer instead of picking an option, scoped to that question. When an option carries an explanation, it renders as a second line under the option label.
- MCP forms can also include **text** fields (typed by their format, so email / URL / date inputs get the matching control), **number** and **integer** fields, and **yes/no** checkboxes. Any field default the agent supplies is pre-filled.
- **Submit** sends your answers back and the turn continues. **Skip** answers nothing (the agent proceeds without your input). **Cancel** aborts the tool call.
- After you answer, the card closes and your picked answer is recorded in the transcript as your turn, so the history shows what you chose instead of jumping straight to the next agent output. Skipping leaves a short "skipped" note; cancelling adds nothing.
- Required fields and every constraint the schema declares (selection min/max, text length, regex pattern, numeric range) are enforced before Submit; the daemon re-validates, so a stale or malformed answer never reaches the agent.

The rich question form is web-only. In the native TUI the card shows the question with a pointer to answer it in the web dashboard, plus keys to skip or cancel from the transcript pane so a TUI-only session never stalls on a question. Once answered (from any surface) the TUI transcript records the chosen answer too.

> AskUserQuestion options can carry a `preview` (a code snippet or mockup shown on focus in the Claude Code CLI/desktop). As of `claude-agent-acp` 0.46 the adapter does forward `preview` (and the option's structured `description`) under an ACP `_meta` extension, but the ACP enum-option type the dashboard parses has no slot for it yet, so previews still cannot be shown here; the option `description` continues to render via the flattened option label.

### Notifications and sound

When an approval lands and you're away from the dashboard, two channels fire:

- **Web push.** If the PWA is installed and notifications are enabled, the daemon sends an OS push tagged `acp-approval-<session>`; tapping it deep-links back. Unlike status-change pushes, approval pushes are not suppressed when the dashboard or TUI is active (focused clients get an in-app toast). See [Push notifications](../push-notifications.md).
- **Browser sound.** The dashboard tab plays `[sound] on_approval` whenever pending approvals go from zero to non-zero. It plays client-side because `boa serve` often runs on a remote box where the host speaker is on the wrong side of the wire.

## Model and reasoning effort

When the ACP adapter advertises them, the composer footer shows a model dropdown and a reasoning-effort selector beside the mode pill. `claude-agent-acp` v0.39.0+ advertises a model selector for every session, and adds a reasoning-effort selector when the current model reports `supportsEffort`. Adapters that advertise neither show no pickers (by design, so non-Claude backends don't grow empty chrome).

Click an option to switch. The chip keeps showing the previous value until the adapter confirms, so it never snaps back on a slow connection. The reasoning-effort dropdown includes a `Default` option that drops any session-level effort pin so the model uses its own default budget. If a switch is rejected (rate limit, transient error), an amber non-blocking notice shows the rejected value and the adapter's reason; it clears when a later snapshot reports the requested value as current. The selector list clears when you switch agents but survives `/clear`.

How the two underlying ACP channels are normalized into one dropdown is in [Structured View Internals](../development/internals/structured-view.md#permission-modes-and-model-channels).

## Session persistence

Structured-view workers and transcripts outlive a `boa serve` restart, a closed laptop, and a reconnect: in-flight turns continue and the next `boa serve` reattaches. To actually terminate a worker, use `boa acp stop <session>` (graceful) or `boa acp kill <session>` (force). For agents that support session restoration (Claude today), the model also retains context across restarts, so a follow-up like "what did we just decide?" still works. The mechanics are in [Structured View Internals](../development/internals/structured-view.md#worker-lifecycle-and-persistence).
