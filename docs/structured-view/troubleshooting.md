# Structured view Troubleshooting

The security model structured view enforces, followed by a field guide to every
failure mode and how to recover. For the day-to-day interface, see
[Structured view Interface](interface.md); for what survives a restart, see
[Persistence & recovery](../development/internals/structured-view.md).

## Security

- Agents never touch the disk directly. They go through ACP's
  `fs/read_text_file` / `fs/write_text_file`, and BOA reads/writes on their
  behalf, enforcing the sandbox roots (the session's worktree plus any explicit
  `--repo` paths).
- Terminal commands run in the session's worktree, or inside the
  `aoe-sandbox-<id>` container (via `docker exec`) when sandbox is enabled.
- Approval nonces are server-generated and single-use; BOA never reveals them
  to the agent, so a compromised agent cannot synthesise approvals.
- Auth tokens (`AOE_TOKEN`) are not forwarded to the agent subprocess.

### Sandbox containers

Structured view sessions honor the wizard's **Run in a safe container** toggle.
When enabled, the ACP agent runs inside the same `aoe-sandbox-<id>` Docker
container the tmux view uses, and the daemon wraps the agent argv in
`docker exec`.

The published `aoe-sandbox` image bundles the ACP adapters structured view
sessions need (`claude-agent-acp`, `codex-acp`, `pi-acp`) alongside the
underlying CLIs whose binaries already provide ACP themselves (`opencode acp`,
`gemini --acp`, `vibe-acp`). Custom sandbox images must include the same
adapters or the `docker exec` invocation fails with exit status 127 and the ACP
handshake times out after 30s.

## Troubleshooting

### `boa acp doctor` says Node is missing

Install Node.js 20 or newer:

- macOS: `brew install node`
- Linux: `apt install nodejs` or `nvm install 20`
- Windows: download from <https://nodejs.org/>

Then re-run `boa acp doctor` to verify. If you have Node installed in a
non-standard location, set `AOE_ACP_NODE=/path/to/node` or configure
`acp.node_path` in `config.toml`.

### `boa acp doctor` says aoe-agent is missing

`aoe-agent` ships with the BOA binary. If the doctor reports it missing, your
install is incomplete. Reinstall BOA via your package manager (e.g.,
`brew reinstall boa`).

### `boa acp doctor` says claude-code adapter is missing

BOA requires a recent `claude-agent-acp`. If your installed adapter is too old,
BOA refuses to start the session and reports the exact required version. Install
the official adapter:

```bash
npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@latest
```

Then run `claude login` if you haven't already. If an older version is pinned by
an internal mirror, ship the required floor from the mirror or run the `@latest`
install above before starting `boa serve`.

### Recovering a missing or out-of-date agent from the web dashboard

When the structured view refuses a session because the agent is missing or too
old, the web dashboard surfaces the reason inline instead of leaving you to read
the logs:

- The compatibility screen shows the installed vs required version and the exact
  install command to copy.
- A missing-binary error message includes the install command for the agent it
  could not find.

Two recovery controls sit on the compatibility screen:

- **Restart agent** respawns the worker and re-runs the version check at the next
  handshake. Use it after you have installed or updated the adapter in a shell;
  no full restart of `boa serve` is needed.
- **Update & restart** runs the agent's `npm install -g` on the host (as the
  user running the daemon) and then respawns. It appears only for
  npm-installable agents (`claude-agent-acp`, `codex-acp`, `gemini`) and only
  when `acp.allow_agent_install` is enabled. Because the install is global, the
  same click also queues **every other session blocked on that same adapter** for
  an automatic respawn, so one update clears every red X at once (the screen
  reports how many other sessions it recovered). When the setting is off the
  button is shown disabled with a hint to enable it.

`acp.allow_agent_install` is **off by default**: running a global package install
from the daemon is a host-level capability that executes the package's npm
lifecycle scripts as the daemon user. It is always blocked in `--read-only` mode,
and the setting is `local_only`, so the web dashboard cannot turn it on (the leaf
is stripped from every web settings write, remote or local). Enable it from the
`boa` TUI settings (Advanced) or in the config file; the button activates on the
next reload. For agents that install some other way (`opencode`, `vibe-acp`,
`pi-acp`), the screen shows the manual command instead of an Update button.
Inside a sandbox session, a host install would not reach the containerized agent,
so the action is refused; install the agent in the container image instead.

### "Failed to start structured view agent" while the adapter is installed

`boa serve` captures the launching shell's PATH at startup. If the adapter lives
under a node-version-manager dir (nvm, fnm, mise, asdf) and the node version on
the daemon's PATH doesn't match, the spawn fails with
`agent spawn failed: No such file or directory`.

Either restart `boa serve` from a shell where `which claude-agent-acp`
resolves, or symlink the binary into a standard dir (`/usr/local/bin`,
`~/.local/bin`, etc.).

### "Project path no longer exists" banner

The session's working directory was renamed, moved, or deleted out from under
`boa serve` (most often a `git worktree move` or a manual `mv`). Two ways to
recover:

1. **Restore the directory at the path the banner shows** (e.g.
   `git worktree move <new> <old>`, or recreate the dir), then click **Retry**.
   Transcript continuity is preserved.
2. **Stop `boa serve`**, edit `project_path` for this session in
   `~/.agent-of-empires/profiles/<profile>/sessions.json` to point at the new
   location (update `worktree_info.branch` too if the branch was renamed), then
   start `boa serve` again. History and `acp_session_id` are preserved; the
   conversation resumes against the new path.

Reinstalling the adapter does not help here; the adapter is fine, the cwd is
gone.

### Agent stopped responding to cancel

If the agent ignores `session/cancel` mid-tool-call, BOA restarts the worker and
resumes the transcript. The structured view shows "Agent stopped responding to
cancel. Restarting worker; your transcript will be preserved" while the respawn
is in flight, and the banner clears once the new worker is online.

Follow-up prompts the daemon refused while the original turn was still in flight
show in the composer as amber "Rejected" pills with a Retry button; clicking
Retry re-dispatches the prompt against the freshly-respawned worker.

### Tool card stuck "running" after a stop

Stopping the agent while a tool call is mid-execution settles that tool's card
to a muted **stopped** state: the elapsed-time timer freezes and the badge
leaves the orange "running" state. This is intentional. "stopped" is neither
"done" nor "failed"; the tool's real outcome was never reported. The same
applies on reload and when the backend switches agents mid-turn.

### Rate-limit recovery

When the active backend hits its rate limit, BOA parks the session rather than
respawning into the same limit. The dashboard shows a banner with the reset
time and a primary **Continue in another agent** CTA. Clicking it opens a picker
of the structured view ACP registry (claude / codex / opencode / gemini / vibe
/ pi / aoe-agent by default, plus anything you've added), preselects `codex`
when installed, switches on confirm, and pre-fills the composer with a recap of
the prior conversation (including your last prompt if it triggered the limit).
Review and send manually; it is not auto-sent.

#### Optional auto-resume after reset

If you would rather stay on the same backend and have BOA pick the session back
up automatically once the limit clears, enable the opt-in setting (off by
default):

```toml
[acp]
rate_limit_auto_resume = true
rate_limit_auto_resume_grace_secs = 15   # cushion added to the reported reset time
```

Both keys are editable in the structured view settings (TUI and web dashboard,
under "Advanced") and can be overridden per profile. The reset time survives an
`boa serve` restart. The manual "Continue in another agent" and reconnect paths
stay available regardless of the setting.

### Switching agents manually

The same hand-off is available at any time, not just during a rate limit. This
matters when you handed a session off (say, claude to codex during a rate limit)
and later want to return to the original agent.

- **Web dashboard:** right-click a structured view session in the sidebar and
  pick "Switch agent". It opens the same picker and switches on confirm. The
  composer is pre-filled with a recap; review and send manually.
- **CLI:** `boa acp switch-agent <session> <target>` (run `boa acp agents` to
  list valid target keys). Pass `--model <name>` to override the model the new
  agent starts with.

The transcript divider reads `Switched structured view agent from <from> to <to>
(manual)`, distinct from the `(rate_limited)` divider the recovery flow emits.

### Native binary launch failure

When the structured view banner shows an error of the form

```text
Claude Code native binary at /usr/lib/node_modules/.../claude exists but failed to launch.
```

the adapter found its bundled Claude Code native sub-binary on disk but `execve`
was rejected by the kernel. Reinstalling `claude-agent-acp` does not help; the
binary is already there.

The common causes:

1. **Architecture mismatch.** The binary's filename ends in a target triple
   (`...-linux-arm64/claude`, `...-linux-x64/claude`). If the host or container
   reports a different arch via `uname -m`, the loader refuses it. Most often an
   `arm64` host pulling an `amd64` image without `--platform`.
2. **Missing dynamic loader or old glibc.** Slim base images sometimes ship
   without `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` or with a glibc too old. `ldd <binary>`
   from inside the container reports the gap.
3. **Bind-mounted `node_modules` across arch.** A host `arm64` binary cannot
   launch in an `amd64` container and vice versa.

Use **Open agent log** on the red startup banner for the verbatim adapter error,
or run `boa acp logs --session <id>`. To inspect the binary:

```sh
docker exec <container> file /usr/lib/node_modules/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-*/claude
docker exec <container> uname -m
```

If the file's arch line does not match `uname -m`, either re-pull the image with
`--platform linux/<host-arch>` or install `claude-agent-acp` inside the
container (rather than bind-mounting from the host).

### Structured view feels "stuck" with no events

- Check `boa acp logs --session <id>`, or **Open agent log** on the red
  startup-error banner in the dashboard.
- Check the dashboard's connection chrome at the top of the view; it shows
  reconnect status if the WebSocket is degraded.
- A repeatedly-failing worker is parked with a red "session parked" banner.
  Retry from the dashboard or run `boa acp restart <session>`.
- A session that was auto-stopped for inactivity and then respawned (for
  example after a version upgrade) used to be able to keep a stale "dormant"
  marker, which made the daemon refuse to bring the worker back after it next
  exited; a follow-up message would then sit unsent. A worker coming online now
  clears that marker, so this no longer strands a queued message.

### "Restarting worker" banner after a turn looked done

Some agents (notably `claude-agent-acp`) occasionally finish a turn, stream
the final message and the end-of-turn usage, but never send the protocol's
turn-complete acknowledgement. The daemon used to treat that as a wedge and
restart the worker, showing **Agent finished but didn't notify the daemon.
Restarting worker; your transcript will be preserved.** When the agent had
already emitted its end-of-turn usage and was not running a background or
scheduled task, the daemon now ends the turn cleanly instead, so a completed
turn no longer triggers a restart. A genuine stall (no end-of-turn usage, or a
monitor / scheduled-wake turn that overran) still restarts the worker and
shows the banner; the transcript is preserved either way.

### Diff viewer is blank (page-restyling browser extensions)

If the Changes panel shows a file's header (path, `+`/`-` counts, the
Unified/Split toggle) but the diff body below is empty, with no error and a
clean console, a page-restyling browser extension is almost certainly
overriding the diff styling. The diff renders into a shadow DOM, and "dark
mode for every site" extensions (Midnight Lizard, DocsAfterDark, and similar)
reach into it and make the rows invisible. This is most common on Firefox.

To confirm it is an extension, open the dashboard in Firefox Troubleshoot Mode
(Menu, Help, Troubleshoot Mode); if the diff renders there, an extension is
the cause. Fix it by disabling the restyling extension for the dashboard, or
allowlist the dashboard origin in the extension's settings.

### "Force end turn" button under the spinner

If the agent finished a turn but the working spinner is still rattling, a small
**Force end turn** button appears beneath it. Click it to clear the spinner and
cancel the agent. It only appears for a silent model with no tool running, and
the view auto-recovers on its own if you do nothing. During healthy streaming, or
while a tool is in flight, the spinner keeps running but the button stays hidden.
While a question or approval card is awaiting your input, both the spinner and the
button are hidden, so the actionable card stands alone.

### Editing settings asks for the passphrase again

When passphrase login is configured, the daily-use structured view flows
(sending prompts, cancelling turns, resolving approvals, switching mode,
restarting workers, attaching terminals) do NOT prompt for the passphrase again.
Your session cookie plus the device-binding secret are sufficient. See #1137.

Editing the persisted config IS gated. Saving the global settings panel,
creating / deleting / renaming a profile, editing a profile's settings, or
changing the default profile requires that your login session has been
"elevated" within the last 15 minutes. The first such action after a fresh page
load surfaces an inline passphrase prompt; subsequent edits inside the same
window go through without re-prompting.

### WebSocket auto-reconnect and keepalive

The view auto-reconnects with exponential backoff if the WebSocket drops, and
resumes the transcript from where it left off so it stays continuous. The banner
shows `Reconnecting (N/7) in Xs...` while the auto-retry is armed, and a manual
**Reconnect** button after the attempts exhaust. Returning the tab to the
foreground triggers an immediate reconnect.


### Approval card vanished without resolving

Approvals expire after `approval_timeout_secs` (default 300). The agent receives
a structured cancellation; you'll typically see a follow-up message asking
again. Bump the timeout if you're in a context where approvals legitimately take
longer.

### `/clear` collapsed earlier turns

When you run `/clear` in a structured view session, the model's context is wiped
on the adapter side but the visible transcript is preserved. The view appends a
"Conversation cleared" divider, resets the active plan, current mode, in-flight
approvals, and usage snapshot, then folds every row above the divider behind a
disclosure banner: `Show N earlier turns (cleared, not in the model's memory)`.
Click the banner to expand the older transcript for your own reference; the
model still won't see those turns. See
[#1101](https://github.com/agent-of-empires/agent-of-empires/issues/1101).

The slash-command palette and mode picker stay populated across a `/clear`.

A `/clear` queued mid-turn (or any agent's clear alias, e.g. codex / opencode
`/new`) fires as its own send when the turn ends. An ordering like `foo`,
`/clear`, `bar` lands as three separate prompts; the queued-prompt strip shows
an amber `fires separately` divider between rows that will land in different
sub-batches. See #1356.

The session cost figure in the composer footer reads "since the most recent
`/clear` (or `/compact`)" rather than session-lifetime cumulative. See #1354.

### Sharing debug logs

`AOE_LOG_LEVEL=debug` (or the legacy `AGENT_OF_EMPIRES_DEBUG=1`) writes agent
stderr verbatim to `debug.log` under the app data dir. We scrub common API-key
prefixes (Anthropic `sk-...`, GitHub `ghp_...`, AWS `AKIA...`, `Bearer <token>`,
etc.) before they hit disk, but the scrub is best-effort; a hand-rolled secret
with no recognisable shape will pass through. Before attaching `debug.log` to a
bug report, skim it for anything that looks like a credential and replace it
with `<redacted>` if needed.
