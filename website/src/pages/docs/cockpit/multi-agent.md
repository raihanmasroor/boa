title: Cockpit Multi-Agent Support
description: "Per-agent cockpit feature matrix: claude, codex, opencode, gemini. Covers profile data, supported tools, and known limitations."
---

AoE's cockpit (the web dashboard's structured-rendering substrate) speaks
the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) and supports every coding agent that ships
an ACP server. Claude has the most polished surface today; other agents
are first-class but lighter on per-tool polish.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | ACP entry | Install |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Claude | `claude-agent-acp` (Zed adapter, requires >=0.37.0) | `npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.37.0` |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `codex-acp` (Zed adapter) | `npm install -g @zed-industries/codex-acp` |
| OpenCode (SST) | `opencode acp` (native) | `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install \| bash` |
| Gemini (Google) | `gemini --acp` (native) | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` |
| Vibe (Mistral) | `vibe-acp` (native) | See https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe |
| Pi | `pi-acp` (adapter) | `npm install -g pi-acp` (plus `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) |
| aoe-agent | bundled | shipped with `aoe` |

Adding a new ACP-capable agent: see `docs/development/adding-agents.md`,
step 8 (Cockpit Profile).

## Feature Matrix

Each cockpit feature either fires for any ACP agent, fires only when the
agent's profile opts in, or is currently claude-only.

| Feature | Claude | Codex | OpenCode | Gemini | Other ACP |
|---------|:------:|:-----:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Streaming agent text | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Tool-call cards (`execute` / `read` / `edit` / `search` / `fetch`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Generic tool card fallback | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Permission / approval flow | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mode picker | ✓ | depends | ✓ | depends | depends |
| Slash command palette | ✓ | depends | ✓ | ✓ | depends |
| Usage / context-window display | ✓ | depends | ✓ | ✓ | depends |
| MCP tool grouping | ✓ | claimed* | claimed* | claimed* | claimed* |
| `/clear` boundary divider | `/clear` | `/new` | `/new` | none | none |
| TodoWrite card | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| Skill card | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| ExitPlanMode synthesis | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| ScheduleWakeup (`/loop`) | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| Subagent indentation | ✓ | — | unverified | — | — |
| Session resume across `aoe serve` restart | ✓ | depends | ✓ | depends | depends |

\* All profiles default to the `mcp__` prefix. If your agent uses a
different MCP naming scheme, file an issue or PR adjusting the profile's
`mcpPrefixes`.

### Notes on the matrix

- **TodoWrite / Skill / ExitPlanMode / ScheduleWakeup** are claude-only
  tools today, so the cards stay quiet on other agents. The cockpit
  doesn't fire those cards based on coincidental tool names; gating
  happens in the agent profile.
- **`/clear`** is detected server-side by matching the user's prompt
  against the profile's `clearAliases`. Claude uses `/clear`; codex and
  opencode use `/new`. Gemini has no slash command verified as a
  conversation-clear boundary; `/restore` is a different semantic, so the
  cockpit doesn't treat it as a clear. The composer's `/` palette also
  surfaces each profile's clear aliases as suggestions, since the
  adapters' own `available_commands_update` channel does not always
  advertise them.
- **Subagent indentation** requires the adapter to emit a
  `_meta.<namespace>.parentToolUseId` field on child tool calls.
  claude-agent-acp emits `_meta.claudeCode.parentToolUseId`. OpenCode's
  `task` tool spawns subagents but its parent-linkage convention hasn't
  been verified, so the cockpit doesn't render the indent until the
  contract is observed.
- **Mode picker / slash palette / usage display** depend on whether the
  adapter advertises the matching channels (`available_modes`,
  `available_commands_update`, `usage_update`). When the adapter doesn't
  emit them, the UI simply stays empty rather than showing stale state.

## How the Profile Works

Each agent has two profile sources, kept aligned by registry key:

- **Server (Rust)**: `src/cockpit/agent_profiles.rs`. Carries
  `parent_meta_namespaces`, `clear_aliases`, and the
  `supports_exit_plan_mode` / `supports_wakeup_tools` capability gates.
- **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `web/src/lib/agentProfiles.ts`. Carries the
  card-classifier alias map (`shell` → execute card, `read_file` → read
  card, etc.), the claude-specialised capabilities (`todos`, `skills`,
  `wakeup`), the MCP prefix list, and the special-title patterns matched
  only when the capability is on.

Profile data is conservative on purpose: where an adapter's tool surface
hasn't been verified hands-on, the entry is omitted rather than guessed.
The cockpit then renders the generic tool card, which is the right
fallback. The user can file a PR adding the alias once they've used the
agent and confirmed the wire shape.

## Known Limitations

- Codex / opencode / gemini cockpit support has been built from adapter
  docs and code reading rather than hands-on session walkthroughs. Some
  tool aliases may need adjustment once each agent has been exercised
  end-to-end. File an issue with the wire `tool.kind` + `tool.name`
  observed on the cockpit side and we'll update the profile.
- Gemini's `save_memory` tool lands on the generic card today. A dedicated
  card is a follow-up.
- Multimodal input (image upload in the composer) is not implemented;
  gemini is the canonical target when it lands.
- Runtime capability discovery from the ACP `InitializeResponse` isn't
  wired yet; profiles are the static source of truth. Runtime discovery
  is tracked separately.

## Diagnosing Profile Issues

If a tool call on a non-claude agent renders as a generic card when you
expect a specialised one:

1. Open browser devtools, find the tool-start WebSocket frame, note
   `tool.kind` and `tool.name`.
2. Check the agent's profile in `web/src/lib/agentProfiles.ts`. The
   alias map only fires when `tool.kind` is `"other"` or not a concrete
   card kind; if the agent sends a real `kind`, that drives dispatch
   directly.
3. If the cockpit fired a claude-only card (TodoCard / SkillCard) on a
   non-claude agent, that's a bug; file an issue with the wire shape.

For server-side gates (clear-boundary detection, plan / wakeup
synthesis), the debug log (`AGENT_OF_EMPIRES_DEBUG=1`) captures which
profile resolved for a session.
