# BOA — Band of Agents

Raihan's fork of [agent-of-empires](https://github.com/agent-of-empires/agent-of-empires)
(MIT). BOA is the console for running a *band* of Claude Code agents across two
Claude accounts, with a conductor that decomposes goals into parallel workers.

## Fork strategy

- `origin` = this repo (`raihanmasroor/boa`), `upstream` = agent-of-empires.
- Upstream ships fast (100+ releases). **Customize via config, launchers, the
  HTTP API, and sidecars first; patch core only when unavoidable** — every core
  patch is future merge debt. Sync regularly:
  `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main`.

## Where things live (verified against v1.12 source)

| Area | Path | Language |
|---|---|---|
| Core (sessions, tmux, worktrees, TUI, serve) | `src/` | Rust |
| Web dashboard | `web/` | TypeScript |
| ACP structured-view workers | `acp-worker/` | Node/TS |
| Plugin API + bundled plugins | `aoe-plugin-api/`, `plugins/` | Rust (external plugin *execution* not wired up yet — see docs/plugins.md) |
| Themes | `themes/` | config |
| HTTP API docs | `docs/api.md` | — |

## Customization roadmap (Raihan OS parity)

### P0 — Dual Claude accounts (config only, no code)
Custom launchers are first-class (docs/features.md: "Wrap any agent in a custom
script… injecting environment variables… per profile or repo"). Already proven
on this machine:
- `~/.local/bin/claude-personal` → `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.claude-personal exec claude "$@"`
- `~/.local/bin/claude-ydo` → `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.claude-ydo exec claude "$@"`
- Sessions: `aoe add --title x --cmd-override ~/.local/bin/claude-ydo --launch`
- TODO: account color-coding in the dashboard session list (`web/`, TS).

### P1 — Conductor (sidecar via the HTTP API, no Rust)
`aoe serve` exposes an orchestration API (docs/api.md): token-authed
`POST /api/sessions/{id}/send` + session CRUD, explicitly intended for
"external orchestrators". Port from agentic-os `command-centre`:
- `src/lib/raihan-os/decompose.ts` — goal → JobSpec[] via `claude -p`
  (heuristic fallback). Reuse nearly as-is.
- `createRun` fan-out → replace tmux exec with BOA API calls
  (create session per job with the per-account launcher, send seed prompt).
- Surface: either a small "conductor" web page in `web/` or a goal box added to
  the dashboard; v0 can be a CLI (`boa-conduct "<goal>"`).

### P2 — Team mailbox (port; nothing upstream has this)
`command-centre/src/lib/raihan-os/mailbox.ts` (DM/broadcast/blackboard between
workers of a run). File-based; works alongside any console. Wire send/read into
seeded worker prompts as in Raihan OS.

### P3 — Approvals with scopes
Upstream has swipe-to-approve + `aoe acp approve --always|--deny`. Evaluate
whether that covers just-once/allow-run semantics from Raihan OS approvals
before porting anything.

### P4 — Identity
Rebrand surfaces (dashboard title/theme in `web/` + `themes/`) — NOT the
binary/crate names (mass-rename = permanent merge conflicts with upstream).

## BOA divergences from upstream (core patches)

Core patches carry merge debt, so each one is listed here with its blast radius.

### Auto-provision ACP adapters at `aoe serve` startup
**Why:** upstream ships the structured (ACP) view but leaves adapter install to
the user — on a fresh box `claude-agent-acp`, `codex-acp`, and the `gemini` CLI
are each missing until someone hand-runs `npm install -g …` (or `aoe acp doctor
--fix`, or the dashboard's "Update & restart"). So every ACP agent renders a
"binary not found" error out of the box.

**What:** at daemon startup BOA probes PATH for each adapter and, for any that is
missing and has an `npm_package_for` mapping, runs `npm install -g <pkg>` once,
serialized, in a background task. It never blocks the HTTP listener, is
best-effort (failures fall back to the existing manual install hints), skips
gracefully when npm is absent, and is skipped in read-only mode.

**Touched (small + surgical):**
- `src/acp/auto_provision.rs` — **new** module (provision logic + injected-closure unit tests + fake-npm smoke).
- `src/acp/mod.rs` — register `pub mod auto_provision;`.
- `src/session/config.rs` — new `acp.auto_install_adapters` toggle (default **true**; same `SettingsSection` pattern as `allow_agent_install`).
- `src/server/mod.rs` — one background `spawn_supervised` block in `start_server`, gated on the flag and `!read_only`.

Provision list: `["claude-agent-acp", "codex-acp", "gemini"]`. Reuses
`install_hints::npm_package_for` (the same npm-only table behind the doctor's
`--fix` and the web install action), so there is one source of truth for which
adapters are npm-installable. Disable with `acp.auto_install_adapters = false`.

### `--remote-control` on interactive Claude sessions
**Why:** upstream launches plain `claude` for terminal sessions, so a
BOA-spawned Claude Code session never registers with Claude Desktop /
claude.ai remote control and is invisible there. We want every interactive
Claude session BOA starts — `add --cmd claude`, the TUI new-session flow, the
web wizard, and resume/fork/restart relaunches — to appear in remote control.

**What:** claude's `AgentDef` carries a new `remote_control_flag:
Some("--remote-control")`; every other agent is `None`. A small helper
(`apply_remote_control_flag`) appends it in the same three interactive command
builders where the yolo flag is applied (sandboxed, host default, host
override), immediately before the resume/fork flags so it survives `--resume
<id>` reconstruction. It is scoped to interactive terminal launches by
construction: print/oneshot mode (`claude -p`, smart-rename / status probes)
builds its argv in a separate function (`smart_rename::build_oneshot_argv`) and
the ACP adapter path spawns separately, so neither receives the flag. Gated on
`session.claude_remote_control` (default **true**; same `SettingsSection`
pattern as `auto_resume_on_restart`); set it false to launch plain `claude`.

**Touched (small + surgical):**
- `src/agents.rs` — new `AgentDef::remote_control_flag` field (`Some` only for
  claude) + a surface-lock test (`test_only_claude_has_remote_control_flag`).
- `src/session/config.rs` — new `session.claude_remote_control` toggle (default
  **true**).
- `src/session/instance.rs` — `apply_remote_control_flag` helper +
  `remote_control_enabled()` resolver, applied at the three interactive builder
  sites; builder tests (fresh / resume-survives / other-agent / toggle-off).
- `src/session/smart_rename.rs` — regression test that print-mode argv omits the
  flag.

**Blast radius:** low. One additive optional field on `AgentDef` (all existing
literals set `None`, claude `Some`), one additive config toggle, and three
one-line helper calls next to the existing yolo application. No change to
resume/fork token insertion, the ACP path, or print-mode argv. Merge risk is a
literal-init conflict if upstream adds an agent or reorders `AgentDef` fields —
resolved by adding `remote_control_flag: None` to the new/edited literal.

### Terminal view is the default for new web-wizard sessions
**Why:** upstream defaults new web-wizard sessions to the structured (ACP) view.
But ACP/structured sessions do **not** get `--remote-control` (see above), so a
structured-by-default web session never registers with Claude Desktop. To keep
new sessions Claude-Desktop-reachable by default, BOA defaults the wizard to the
terminal view, matching the CLI/TUI default. The structured view stays one click
away via the wizard's **Use structured view** toggle, and an existing session
can be switched at any time from the session header (see the view-switch control
below).

**What:** the session wizard's `useStructuredView` field defaults to `false`
instead of `true`. The field is deliberately client-only (not persisted, not
seeded from `/api/settings`, not tracked in `profileDirty`), so a server config
knob would be disproportionate — this is a one-line default flip with the
divergence called out in an inline comment. The submit path is unchanged
(`view: acpCapable && useStructuredView ? "structured" : "terminal"`), and the
Claude Code import path still forces the structured view on explicitly.

**Touched:**
- `web/src/components/session-wizard/wizardReducer.ts` — `initialData.useStructuredView`
  flipped `true → false` with a BOA-divergence comment.
- `web/src/components/session-wizard/steps/AgentOptions.tsx` — doc comments updated
  (the switch now reads default-off).
- Tests updated to assert the new default:
  `wizardReducer.test.ts` and `__tests__/structuredViewToggle.test.tsx`.

**Blast radius:** minimal. One default value in a client reducer plus test
expectations; no server, schema, or wire-format change.

### Discoverable structured↔terminal view switch in the web session header
**Why:** the per-session view switch (`POST /api/sessions/:id/acp/{enable,disable}`,
which restarts the agent in a fresh pane, preserving the worktree/files/commits
but resetting the in-memory conversation) already existed server-side but was
only reachable from the TUI. With terminal now the web default, users need an
obvious way to opt a live session into the structured view (and back).

**What:** a labeled control in the TopBar session header (shown when a session
is active) that switches the active session to the other view. It offers
**Terminal view** for a structured session, and **Structured view** for a
terminal session only when the agent is `acp_capable` (so it never surfaces a
switch the server would reject). Clicking confirms first (carrying the
restart/history-reset warning), calls the existing endpoint, then refreshes the
session list so the pane re-renders. Hidden in read-only mode.

**Touched:**
- `web/src/lib/api.ts` — `switchSessionView(id, target)` wrapping the existing
  enable/disable endpoints.
- `web/src/App.tsx` — `handleSwitchView` (confirm + call + refresh) passed to TopBar.
- `web/src/components/TopBar.tsx` — the inline switch control.

**Blast radius:** low and web-only. No new endpoints (reuses the existing
server switch) and no Rust changes.

### Per-account "profile" cards in the new-session picker
**Why:** the P0 dual-account trick (see the roadmap above) worked only via
hand-written `claude-personal` / `claude-ydo` PATH wrappers that export
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. The web wizard's "Which AI agent?" step showed one card per
agent and always launched the default account, so a second Claude login was
invisible there. We want the picker to scan the host for each agent's real
logged-in accounts and offer each as its own pickable card, launching the chosen
one on that account.

**What:** a read-only filesystem scan discovers the distinct logged-in accounts
("profiles") per agent using each CLI's credential/state files, and the wizard
renders one card per account **only when 2+ exist** (single-account agents keep
their one plain card). Picking a card injects that account's config-dir env at
launch:
- **Claude** — enumerates `~/.claude*` directories (dropping the `~/.claude.json`
  files). Default `~/.claude` (creds in the macOS Keychain + `~/.claude.json`)
  launches with **no** override; alternates (`~/.claude-personal`, `~/.claude-ydo`,
  each with its own `.credentials.json`/`.claude.json`) inject
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<dir>`. This is exactly what the old wrappers did.
- **Codex** — `~/.codex*` dirs with an `auth.json`; separate accounts inject
  `CODEX_HOME=<dir>` (NOT `-p/--profile`, which layers config within one home).
  Single account today → one plain card.
- **Gemini** — the CLI has no verified per-account config-dir env var, so only the
  single `~/.gemini` account is surfaced and no account switch is attempted.

The chosen account's env is submitted as `agent_env`, **re-validated server-side
against the same discovery** (so a tampered request can't inject arbitrary host
env), stored on the instance, and appended to `profile_host_environment()` so it
flows to BOTH the launch prefix and the status-hook install path (hooks land in
the chosen account's config dir). The existing `--remote-control` divergence is
untouched — the env is a prefix, not a flag change.

**Session/weekly limits:** intentionally **not** shown. The investigation found
**no real local source** for Claude/Codex/Gemini usage limits (verdict: not
available), so per the "be honest" rule we omit the limit line entirely rather
than fabricate a number or show a permanent "—" that implies a broken feature.
If a real local source is later confirmed, attach it to each `AgentProfile`.

**Touched (additive):**
- `src/agent_profiles.rs` — **new** module: `AgentProfile`, per-agent discovery
  predicates, `validate_agent_env`, + unit tests. Registered in `src/lib.rs`.
- `src/server/api/system.rs` — `AgentInfo.profiles` field, populated in
  `list_agents` (builtin) and empty for custom agents.
- `src/server/api/sessions.rs` — `CreateSessionBody.agent_env` + server-side
  `validate_agent_env` before building the instance.
- `src/session/builder.rs` — `InstanceParams.agent_env` → `instance.agent_env`.
- `src/session/instance.rs` — persisted `Instance.agent_env` (serde default) +
  `profile_host_environment` appends it.
- TUI/CLI `InstanceParams` sites pass `agent_env: Vec::new()` (web-only feature).
- `web/`: `AgentProfile` type + `AgentInfo.profiles`, `CreateSessionRequest.agent_env`,
  wizard `agentEnv` state (reset on tool change), profile-card expansion in
  `AgentPickerEssentials`, submit wiring in `SessionWizard`, + a component test.

**Blast radius:** low. One new always-empty-by-default persisted field on
`Instance`/`InstanceParams` (only `Instance::new` is a full literal; all test
helpers use it), one additive `AgentInfo`/`CreateSessionBody` field, and the
`profile_host_environment` append. Merge risk is a literal-init conflict if
upstream reorders those structs — resolved by adding `agent_env: Vec::new()`.
